# Learn Vim
As I know before, Vim is just a editor with much difficult keyword to remember. But after I have learned Vim in Last two day, I'm really fall in love with Vim which is not only as a editor but also as a great tools to code. With so many contribution in the internet. Vim gradually become very powerful. With thousands of hundreds of plugin in the internet, we can make our vim as an "IDE". And Vim not just as a tool but also become a script language known as Vimscript. And now I can readly know how powerful vim is.
